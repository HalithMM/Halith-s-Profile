            <h1 class="fs-4 my-5">An Enhanced Network Monitoring and Threat Detection System <span class="lead">Final year Project (2024)</span></h1>
            <h3 class="fs-4 my-2 text-black">Objective</h3>
            <p class="lead">•<b>Real-Time Threat Detection:</b> Develop a system capable of monitoring
                            network traffic in real-time and detecting security threats as they occur, with
                            minimal latency. <br>
                          •<b>Anomaly Detection:</b> Implement algorithms and techniques to identify
                            anomalies in network traffic, including unauthorized access attempts,
                            unusual data patterns, and potential security breaches. <br>
                          • <b> Port Scanning and Service Identification:</b> Create a Port Scanner module to
                            actively scan network ports, identify running services, and pinpoint
                            vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. <br>
                          • <b>Automation of Analysis:</b> Utilize Python's Scapy library to automate the
                            capture and analysis of network packets, ensuring efficient processing and
                            detection of threats without the need for persistent data storage. <br>
                           •<b>Swift Response Mechanisms:</b> Design mechanisms for immediate response
                             to detected threats, including alerts to network administrators, automated
                            mitigation actions, and logging for forensic analysis.</p>
            <h3 class="fs-4 text-black my-2">Project Overview</h3>
            <p class="lead">The proposed project aims to revolutionize network security by introducing
                an innovative system focused on real-time threat detection and proactive
                vulnerability management. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on reactive
                measures, this system leverages state-of-the-art techniques to monitor network
                traffic in real-time, utilizing Python's Scapy library for packet analysis without the
                need for persistent data storage. Key components include a Pcap Analyzer for
                detecting anomalies and potential breaches as they occur and a Port Scanner
                module for identifying open ports and pinpointing vulnerabilities.</p>
            <h3 class="fs-4 text-black my-3">Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="lead"><strong>Easy Integration</strong> It seamlessly imports pre-captured PCAP files, facilitating
                    user-friendly operations.
                </li>
                <li class="lead"><strong>Detailed Packet Analysis</strong> Extracts key details like IPs, packet lengths, and
                    protocols across various network protocols, ensuring comprehensive network
                    traffic analysis.
                </li>
                <li class="lead"><strong>Efficient Port Scanning</strong> The Port Scanner Module effectively identifies open
                    ports and optimizes connections, contributing to better network management
                    and security
                </li>
                <li class="lead"><strong>Protocol-Level Security Analysis</strong>Conducts in-depth analysis of various
                    network protocols to detect and address security anomalies, improving threat
                    identification.</li>
