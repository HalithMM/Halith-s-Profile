            <h1 class="fs-4 my-5"> Patient Flow Optimization System</h1>
            <h3 class="fs-4 my-2 text-black">Objective</h3>
            <p class="lead">To design and implement a full-stack web application that optimizes patient flow in healthcare facilities, 
                reducing wait times and improving overall operational 
                efficiency through real-time queue management and secure backend processes.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fs-4 text-black my-2">Project Overview</h3>
            <p class="lead">This application aims to streamline the management of patient queues in clinics and hospitals. It provides real-time updates on patient waiting times and queue positions, ensuring better communication between healthcare providers and patients. <br>
                The backend is securely managed with Django, and the system leverages MySQL for efficient data storage. The application is designed to enhance user experience by offering smooth interface interactions and reliable performance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="lead"><strong>Real-Time Queue Updates:</strong> Patients and staff can view live updates of the current queue status, improving the flow of patient appointments</li>
                <li class="lead"><strong>Secure Backend Management:</strong> Django ensures that sensitive patient information and queue data are securely handled, following best practices in web security.</li>
                <li class="lead"><strong>Data Storage:</strong> MySQL is used to store patient data and appointment schedules, ensuring efficient and scalable data management.</li>
